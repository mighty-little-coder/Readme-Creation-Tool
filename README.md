  ## Description
  
  The purpose of this application is to utilize a pre-made framework of a professional README to structure your own README file easily. This command line application is designed to take in user inputs to complete construction of the README using the inquirer package. The challenge in creating this command line application was creating the questions within the terminal. From there, we learn how to create a whole new file locating within the working folder.
